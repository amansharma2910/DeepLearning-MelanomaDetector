<h1 align = 'center'> Melanoma (Skin Cancer) Detection using Deep Learning</h1>

In this project, originally a Kaggle image classification competetion, I'll be working on a deep learning pipeline that processes the input images of possible cancerous moles/tumors and predicts the probability of the mole(s) being melanoma (skin cancer).

 Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of skin cancer that develops from the pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines or eyes. About 25% of melanomas develop from moles. Changes in a mole that can indicate melanoma include an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness or skin breakdown.  
 
The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of the skin pigment melanin. The UV light may be from the sun or other sources, such as tanning devices. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members and poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic conditions such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase the risk.

Diagnosis is by biopsy and analysis of any skin lesion that has signs of being potentially cancerous.

<h2>Project Objectives:</h2>

* Implementing a binary-classification deep learning CNN model in PyTorch capable of detecting presence of Melanoma from the images of the affected sites
* Performing basic EDA to find trends within the data
* Comparing the performance of different CNN architectures for the model

<h2>Understanding the Problem Statement:</h2>

The problem at hand is a binary-image-classification problem where given an input image, we want our model to classify the tumor/mole in the image as benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

Each image that we are dealing with is an 3-channelled RGB images of varying sizes.
